Dear sir/madam,

I am writing in connection to the job you advertised on GumTree on the 25th of January, a bar back position. I enclose my CV for your information.

As you can see, I have experience in working as a bartender and managing bar related duties. I am a bright and hard working individual with a friendly personality and the ability to work as part of a team, possessing good communication skills. Paying attention to details and being highly organised makes me a good candidate for the offered position, while my eagerness to pick up new skills keeps me motivated to do my job, regardless of difficulties.

I am mostly available for work during the weekends, but I could cope with some weekdays afternoons as well.

Yours sincerely,
Ciprian Tomoiaga

As you can see, I have solid experience in the field of Computer Science. I am a hard working and devoted individual, looking to help you accomplish your job as efficient as possible. I have good knowledge of Microsoft Office, especially in Word documents, Excel datasheets and Access databases. One of my key skills is the fast learning ability, supported by a deep motivation of being informed and up to date with information.
